	<string>About</string>
	<string>The Koolo app is designed and developed as part of the KULU project, a research and design project based at the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo. KULU stands for Cool technology for youth with long-term health challenges.</string>
	<string>We developed the KOOLO app for research purposes and we hope to add some new functionality in the future.</string>
	<string>You are free to use it, but please donâ€™t expect any support or maintenance from us, except when you participate in our research project.</string>
	<string>You are also free to build upon it (adapting it or adding functionality) as long the app remains a non-commercial product, you credit the contributors, and you license the new creation under identical license terms.</string>
